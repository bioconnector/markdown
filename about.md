# About

## Why?

This reference was created in support of a [workshop](http://bioconnector.org/workshops) on reproducible research using dynamic documents in R.

## Hey, stuff's missing!

This isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide to either Markdown or RMarkdown. You can find plenty of those elsewhere. This is here to provide a bare-bones, zero-entry introduction to writing documents with Markdown and dynamic documents with RMarkdown for someone who's never written anything outside of a word processor. That is, here you'll find only the stuff you need to get started and not all the extra frills to distract you.
